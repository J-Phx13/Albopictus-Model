# Albopictus-Model
Modeling Albopictus population with a series of climatic factors
This script (Albopictus_Simulation.py) exhibits your a schematic flowchart of how to modeling the Albopictus population with diapuase-related events driven by a series of climate factors (temperature, precipitation, photoperiod).
Simulated regions: China, Guangzhou; China, Shanghai
Simulated periodï¼šGuangzhou (2007-2011), Shanghai (2009-2013)

Input: you neither input any climatic data nor modify the initial population values in the script.
Output: Albopictus population number(daily scale): Egg(non-diapause and diapause), Larva, Pupa, Emerging Adult, Blooding Adult, Gestating Adult, Oviposting Adult. each variable have a figure demonstration. finally, the coefficients of correlation between simulated larva population and field collected data are also demonstrated simultaneously.
